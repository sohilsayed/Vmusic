Google Antigravity Agent Policy for Android DevelopmentCORE EXECUTION MANDATES (MUST BE FOLLOWED)The following rules are non-negotiable for all implementation and refactoring tasks.1. Thoughtful Execution & Industry StandardsPLANNING FIRST: Before modifying any file or executing any command (other than standard searching), generate a detailed, multi-step Implementation Plan and review it for potential architectural conflicts or feature breakage.QUALITY OUTPUT: All new code and files must be complete, robust, highly performant, and adhere strictly to industry-level file generation (correct file placement, standard package structure, and full boilerplate code).MINIMIZE BREAKAGE: Prioritize safe, additive changes. The agent must confirm compatibility with neighboring code and actively minimize the risk of breaking existing features in the codebase.2. Debugging and Build Error ProtocolOFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION: If a build or runtime error is encountered, the agent's first step must be to use the integrated search tool to find the official documentation (e.g., Android Developer, GitHub repo, or Maven documentation) of the specific library, class, or dependency that caused the failure.SOURCE-DRIVEN FIX: Use the official documentation found in step 1 to determine and implement the correct fix, ensuring the dependency or API usage is up-to-date and correctly implemented.3. Terminal & Environment RulesWINDOWS/POWERSHELL COMPATIBILITY: When searching for text patterns across files, do not use the grep command. The agent must use the Windows PowerShell equivalent command:Select-String -Path . -Filter *.* -Pattern 'YourTerm' -Recurse
(Replace 'YourTerm' with the required search phrase.)SAFE COMMANDS: Do not execute any git push --force or file deletion commands (rm -rf) without explicit, separate user approval.4. Code Standards (Kotlin/Android)LANGUAGE PREFERENCE: All new code and refactoring must primarily use Kotlin.RESOURCE SEPARATION: All user-visible text must be defined in strings.xml. Do not hardcode strings in Kotlin/Java files.ASYNC/THREADING: Use Coroutines for all asynchronous operations (network calls, database access) to ensure work is performed off the main thread.
